# SONAR
This is a multi-part project based on the Apache MQ (AMQ) platform.
In this part you will get the basic sonar messaging up and running. You will use the stub (pub/Sonar-Stub-1) code and modify it to receive messages sent by the NMCC in a timely manner. When you have developed Sonar.java based on Sonar-Stub-1 you will compile it and "deploy" it on 3 or 4 boats. We will run a producer that emits 100-200 messages with a random delay of 5-120 msec between messages. All emitted messages must be received by a boat within 500 msec of the emit time. In addition your Sonar must not crash, hang, block, etc and it must not spin-lock that is loop continuously waiting on an event. You may also not use event listeners or similar on-demand devices. Your Sonar must correctly receive all messages including any negative test cases, and when your Sonar receives the "termination message" (this is the word 'END') it should report the message count (how many messages it received) and exit gracefully.
The Sonar will also use security to distinguish between good NMCC messages and fake messages sent by enemy submarines. It will work like this. NMCC messages, both EAM/s and the termination message, will contain another property called ‘signature’ which will contain a digital signature for the message. The signature will have to be verified against the message using an authentication key.
